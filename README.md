1.	A developer is assigned a task to scrape 1 lakh website pages from a directory site, while scrapping he is facing such hcaptcha, which are placed to stop people from scrapping As a project Coordinator suggest ways to solve this problem
   
Solution: To deal with the Captcha challenges when scraping a lot of website pages, we use both technical and smart approaches. We study why these challenges appear and then make our scraping process act more like a human. We change our internet settings and how fast we scrape. We also think about what pages are most important to scrape. We might even get some help from tools that can solve the Captcha. We need to keep an eye on the process and make sure it follows the rules and is allowed. And as things change, we adjust our strategy to keep going smoothly.

2.	Our client has around 10k linkedin people profiles, he wants to know the estimated income range of these profiles. Suggest ways on how to do this?
   
Solution: To estimate the income range of 10,000 LinkedIn profiles, we can use various business analytics techniques. Since income data is not typically available on LinkedIn, we need to employ indirect methods. This includes leveraging data enrichment services, industry benchmarks, and location-based estimates to make educated guesses. We can also analyze job titles, educational backgrounds, and LinkedIn connections, which may be associated with income levels. If possible, machine learning models can be trained using historical data with known income information. Importantly, we should always respect privacy and ethical considerations, ensuring compliance with LinkedIn's terms of use and data privacy regulations. While these approaches provide estimates and may not be perfectly accurate, they enable us to make informed approximations of income ranges based on available profile data.

 3. We have a list of 1L company names, need to find linkedin company links of these profiles, how to go about this?

    
Solution: To find LinkedIn profiles for 100,000 companies, first, clean up the company names to make them neat. Then, we can try to get the LinkedIn profiles automatically, using LinkedIn's tools or other sources. If that's not possible, we can look for the profiles manually by searching on LinkedIn. We need to be careful about matching the right profiles to the right companies, and we can use computers to help with this. We also need to check the data for mistakes and make sure we're following the rules. This process might take some time and effort, but it's essential for getting the information we need accurately.

4.	How to identify list of companies whose tech stack is built on Python. Give names of 5 companies if possible, by your suggested approach
   
Solution: To find companies that use Python in their technology, we can search for words like "Python" in job listings and company descriptions. We'll make a big list of companies and then filter it to find ones that really use Python. Some well-known companies that use Python a lot are Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Instagram, and Netflix. 

5.	Need to find an API, through which we can send linkedin messages to other linkedin users
   
Solution: I guess, LinkedIn does not offer a public API for sending direct messages to LinkedIn users programmatically. LinkedIn has restrictions in place to prevent misuse and maintain a quality user experience. While they have a Messaging API, it is typically reserved for use within LinkedIn's own platforms and applications, and not generally accessible to third-party developers or businesses. To explore this further, I would recommend checking LinkedIn's developer resources and contacting their developer support for the latest information on APIs and their usage policies. If a direct messaging API is not available, alternative communication methods like email may need to be considered for business messaging and analytics purposes.
